        <p>I'm Ruby Hembree, a 2nd year LMC Major at Georgia Tech with threads in Media and Design, and I'm glad you're here! <br><br>
        A bit about me: My pronouns are she/her, I like to play guitar, write music and poetry, read, cook, and spend time with my friends. I have 6 siblings, and I'm from Carrollton, Georgia. Currently, I'm working on campus as an intern within the Writing and Communication Program within Stephen C. Hall. I worked there all summer and I've been able to write articles, record podcasts, design fliers on InDesign, create content for podcasts, videos, and a grant-funded Twitter account dedicated to children's literature. I want to use this page as a place to showcase my interests and work, a sort of personal journal of everything I make. Explore and enjoy!</p>
