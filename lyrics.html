        <b><u>Time Takes us</u></b><br><br>
            Felt on my fingers 
        <br>
        <br>Ginger in your eyes
        <br> rapid penny whispers 
        <br>inscribed on my thighs 
        <br>so take your red elephants 
        <br>and run them across my eyes 
        <br>
        <br>I'm simply in love with you 
        <br>
        <br>the blue moon in your basket 
        <br>and towels on the floor
        <br>I tried to run for cover 
        <br>but my heart can't hide no more 
        <br>I've been running round your city,
        <br>my feet are getting sore,
        <br>
        <br>I'm simply in love with you 
        <br>
        <br>I'ts raining on the rooftops 
        <br> the painters took a break, 
        <br>the builders drink their coffee 
        <br>but the dreamers are still awake 
        <br>and as our night is ending, 
        <br>there's a thought I hope you take, 
        <br><br>I'm simply in love with you <br><br>
        Monuments to masters, 
        <br>and scrapings felt in the wall,
        <br>a makings of a sentiment 
        <br>that picks up when you call
        <br>so let me sleep in your side car
        <br>I'll be silent through it all 
        <br>
        <br>I'm simply in love with you. 
        <br>
        <br>

            <b><u>MoMA</u></b>
            <br><br>
            The bees in my head <br>
            Have fumbled and bred<br>
            So now all the wasps <br>
            are dead<br>
            Fall Down.<br>
            God's tears in my hair<br>
            I'll sip 'em and stare<br>
            And if he may cry<br>
            I'll wear<br>
            His crown.<br><br>
            Cause all of my time was spent on them<br>(on them)<br>
            and bottles could never replace my friends<br>(no ma'am)<br><br>
            The storm on the sea<br>
            The way you see me<br>
            are both telling me<br>
            I believe<br>
            To calm down<br>
            These grapefruit dreams <br>
            and your canteloupe teeth<br>
            they sit on my counter<br>
            and sleep<br>
            while I frown<br><br>
            Cause I never learned to reap what I sow<br> (oh no)<br>
            But loving you's easy and I should know <br>(I should know)<br><br>
            Cause all of my time was spent on them<br> (on them)<br>
            and bottles could never replace my friends<br> (my friends)<br>
            But you'll have to forgive me if I weep<br>
            Cause the way that you touch me makes me<br>
            Creep<br><br><br>
            
            <b><u>Backdrop</u></b><br><br>
            I know that I can get quiet<br>
            and I don't think that you like it <br>
            but I appreciate you shutting your mouth.<br>
            I know that I can get quiet<br>
            and I don't think that you like it<br>
            but it's nice to know you'll stay when I'm south.<br><br>
            
            I'm scared<br>
            to let this all out<br>
            cause they all run away<br>
            when my heart tumbles out<br>
            But I think I'm prepared<br>
            to tear down a wall<br>
            maybe the rest will fall down<br>
            and we <br>
            could be small<br><br>
            Against the backdrop of a world<br>
            That won't let me feel hurt<br>
            without guilt<br>
            without shame<br>
            how could I <br>
            ever claim<br>
            to even know what it's like to be loved?<br>
            Cause the ones from before <br>
            always took so much more<br>
            and I just can't seem to push when I'm shoved.<br>
            
            I feel the fear in my heartbeat<br>
            I feel like falling off my seat<br>
            the wind could blow me around the room<br>
            But your patience is changing me and <br>
            your whispers bring clarity<br>
            Now I'm crawling out of my tomb<br><br>
            
            You're here<br>
            and that's more than they can say<br>
            but when I'm not so sweet<br>
            will you still stay<br>
            when these tears<br>
            pool up and we drown<br>
            can you twist my smiles<br>
            so they won't see me frown?<br><br>
            
            Cause I walk through a cruel world<br>
            That won't let me feel burnt<br>
            without cigarette smoke<br>
            that'll stain<br>
            and will choke <br>
            and <br>
            keep my lungs filled up with my words<br>
            so I cry<br>
            and I quake<br>
            How could I<br>
            ever make someone<br>
            see me clearly instead of blurred?<br>
            but I found some hope<br>
            In<br>
            You<br><br><br>
        </p>
