        <b><u>A loved Letter</u></b>
        <br><br>envelope me <br>
        in your dark red sweater<br>
        and stamp me with a kiss<br>
        <br>
        send me out into a belligerent world,<br>
        where my corners will wear and tear,<br>
        and my ink will be smudged,<br>
        and my address isn't so clear.<br>
        <br>
        But know, that wherever I may rest,<br>
        in the basket and cargo of those who<br>
        know not what I carry,<br>
        know that I hold your love letters and tokens of care.<br><br>
        Know that however far I may be from you,<br>
        I will always come back to your mailbox.<br>
        sitting by your doorstep, ready to be opened by your<br>
        gentle hands,<br>
        my white dressings shredded by your knife.<br>
        Lay me across your kitchen table and <br>
        take in all you last gave me.<br><br><br>
        
        <b><u>Alienated</u></b>
        <br><br>Only here,<br>
        in my city of spaghetti,<br>
        of pencils and kings and queens,<br>
        could I rest on the urban green.<br>
        Chosen families play their flowering notes and <br>
        spread their graceful budding arms to the<br>
        pale sun.<br>
        Breezy stoners blow by and <br>
        I can see home in the scope of my thumb.<br>
        Grass within and without, <br>
        I feel a softening strength.<br>
        Sandra sings me to sleep as I <br>
        reflect on this kingdom.

    <b><u>RAGE</u></b>, published in Erato
        <br><br>
        Manipulation, desecration, frustration.
        <br><br>
        My words are in a Gordian knot, wrapped around my head, tying my tongue and crossing my fingers. 
        <br><br>
        I want to will them to fly from my mouth or hands in the pattern I envision, but clear thoughts condense and dampen my inscriptions. 
        <br><br>
        Revision, decisions, derision
        <br><br>
        I try to explain all my love and pain, but the words muddle in my stomach and I vomit on my paper, black and white memories spat out haphazardly.
        <br><br>
        I already feel the criticisms. They fill my mind and my foggy passion disappears and my own assailings rise and shine on all my failures.
        <br><br>
        Regression, depression, repression, progression.
        <br><br>
        For the first time, I let my mind continue to try. For the first time, I let my fingers continue to fly. I can’t spit beauty and I can’t craft my verses but my soul is in ink before me and it feels like the blackness that collected there was dripping from my fingers and marking this paper.
        <br><br>
        My rage is my catalyst, my sadness will inspire and my heart is now a well.
        <br><br><br>
        
<b><u>3AM</u></b>
<br><br>
Nothing good ever happens after 3 AM.
<br><br>
When the dark of the night is quiet and calm,
But only suggests a stillness that is ready to be broken with 
The screams of the damned, or the damning,
Rippling in the air. 
When the steam in the hot July air 
Rises off our suffering, sinning flesh 
And the flames of our transgressions 
Burn away my clarity.
<br><br>
I Won’t, I Won’t, I Won’t.
I tell myself as I walk to him in the 
Heat of the summer,
Sweat dripping down my neck and 
From my palms, 
This Evil Bite
Begging me to scratch 
And give in.
The bugs have stopped humming.
The warm wind is not blowing.
The moon has left me.
There’s only the grave sense of opportunity and myself,
Finding our way in the dark to him in this steaming, sinister 
silence.
<br><br>
And then, after the pitter-patter of the Gentle Dance, 
Light touches that bring us closer and 
Closer to the inevitable Press,
The merging of the blood and the body.
Becoming red and hot and fast and hard and quick and scary and no no no
<br><br>
“We shouldn’t”
<br><br>
But we do.
<br><br>
The vampire in my heart drains me of my will.
His hands around my neck break me.
It’s so different, so much hotter than
Winter Love.
Our Summer Lust truly
Possessed me. 
<br><br>
And I find myself drenched, drowning in my guilt when the Press is pulled apart,
Farther than before, and
We become petals drifting apart after the tug of a child. 
<br><br>
My guts are wrenching.
no nO NO
The what and who and how and why
Circle my wrists and chain me to the idea
That he won’t be here tomorrow.
And I’m pulled away far and far,
Back to my dirty dungeon where I could never let him enter.
<br><br>
How do I unchain myself?
Is honesty the line I take? 
Or pretend all is well and I and the world are as perfect
(Or less than so)
Since I forgot myself for the chance of a touch.
A caress.
A love.
<br><br>
Now it’s 6 AM.
The witches and demons have receded back to hell as
The sun rises over our Pieces,
But the sin is blue on my skin, 
And all I want is to be yours again.
<br><br><br>
        
      <b><u>The Difference</u></b><br><br>  
     The first time you dip your foot in a shallow, cool pool.
        <br><br>
The first time you stay up for a sunset and a sunrise, watching the light of the world dim and dawn, holding the dark hours in between inside your lungs, like holding a long breath.<br>
The first time their name lights up your phone, asking for your voice.
<br><br>
You will find me.
<br><br>
The first date. <br>
The first kiss.<br>
The first I Love You.<br>
The first fight.<br>
The first sting.<br>
The first Goodbye.<br>
<br>
You will find me.<br>
For I am the excitement in every unknown.
<br><br>
The last time you skipped a stone.
The last time you played outside with your friends in the dying summer, the sun waving goodbye as green and blue fade to brown and purple, the color draining from the land and the wind blowing away the warmth from your clothes.
The last time you heard their voice.
<br><br>
I will find you.
<br><br>
The last date.<br>
The last kiss.<br>
The last I Love You.<br>
The last fight.<br>
The last sting.<br>
The last Goodbye.<br>
<br><br>
I will find you.<br>
For you are the misery in every known.
  <br><br><br>
        
<b><u>Cadaver</u></b>,
        published in Erato<br><br>
        I need to open my mouth.<br><br>
Let the moths that have been flying around In my stomach out.
        <br>
The atoms have been bouncing off my walls.
<br>Colliding, gliding, fighting, igniting
<br>Such sparks that I think I’m burning from
<br>The Inside.
<br>I can’t breathe.
<br>They’re in my throat.
<br>Flapping their ominous grey wings
<br>With eyes that see what I don’t and 
<br>Hold what I can’t.
<br>
Carrier pigeons with cries for help 
<br>Tied around their ankles,
<br>And bees with the sweetest notes of pollen,
<br>Honey ready to be made in your ears. 
<br>But the membrane my cells have created 
<br>At the back of my throat is coated in Self-<br>Preservation.
<br>And the moat in my stomach is filled with acidic <br>Fear.
<br>My tongue is blue, 
<br>That Yellow Ribbon is tied tight,
<br>And I’m shut off.
<br>The Power is out.
<br>They never paid the bill.
<br>
<br>Pry open my wired jaw.
<br>Let the sun pour over my lips and light this
<br>Vessel of potential.
<br>Let the rusty cages break apart
<br>And the fluttering feelings fly,
<br>Break the silence and 
<br>Speak!
<br>Because I wonder 
<br>If I will either explode in a firework of 
<br>Fiery, colorful candidness
<br>Or choke on the words 
<br>Clogging in my neck,
<br>Splitting my esophagus,
<br>Leaking the toxicity back into my blood
<br>To circulate around my body 
<br>And rotting me from the inside 
<br>Out. 
<br><br><br>
        <b><u>Unnamed Poetry</u></b>
        <br><br>
    1. You're dinner rolls at the beginning of every meal.
        <br>
        I love the way you feel.
        <br>
        You're flowers on the table at noon,
        <br>
        A lit candle in the middle of June,
            <br>
            I don't need you, but I do.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
    2. I love when sleep sneaks up on me, 
        <br>
        Slowly Slinking steps through my hair,
        <br>
        Crawling quitely into my ears, 
        <br>
        tip-toeing over my eyelids and,
        <br>
        finally,
        <br>
        i drift.......
        <br>
            without a trace of knowledge that I've been hit with a ton of bricks.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
    3. Sweet boy, I can't imagine the treadmills you run in your mind. <br>Staying so Flatline,<br> you shudder when your heart feels mine. <br>I can't see your dark hair or warm eyes for the<br> skunk spray you keep around you at night.<br> I know it may hurt, but let it in! <br>Staying so blue can get under your skin.<br><br> But we both know you prefer yellow. <br><br>I'll be with you when you're every color of the rainbow. <br>You're going to be okay, <br>you're going to be okay.<br> Not tomorrow,<br> not today,<br> but if there's weed, <br>there's a way.
            <br><br><br>
    I'm not someone to love <br>or someone to hate<br> I'm merely the sounds that <br>reverberate <br>through your doors, <br>off your walls,<br> up your staircase,<br> down your halls.<br> I'll turn your house into a home<br> I'm the feeling of being <br>happy<br> alone.
            <br><br><br>
    Pages and pages<br> of people and places  <br>biding their time <br>riding their lines <br>breathing our air <br>pretending they care <br>wishing to go<br> but staying at home <br>we're dressed and we're fed,<br> but then we're all dead.
            <br><br><br>
    It piles and piles and piles <br>for miles and miles and miles <br>it's pressing dots and dimples in my chest. <br>I can't remember details, <br>I sold my soul for retail,<br> and dripped and drained my tear ducts on your desk.<br> And if you ever wish to find me, <br>to bleed and bed you're "sorry", <br>I'll bloom into an orchid of your doom. <br>I'll take your cheeks so gently, <br>and say "you never met me", <br>this while jagged moths consume your wounds.
            <br><br><br>
    Stupid slothes and rabid rabbits bite at my blue toes. <br>Angry apples and vodka samples sit with me like stones <br>an empty jar upon the table <br>remains of an even score,<br> and tissue paper lines my stockings<br> while I say "I love you more"
            <br><br><br>
    I like the way you are <br>I like the way you speak<br> I like acting stupid and getting to be weak<br> I fell in love with a loser<br> but he's a winner in my eyes <br>a funny little charmer, the love of my life.
